## How to Run  

Clone the repository:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
npm install  # or yarn install
npm start  # or yarn start
```

## User Research & Feedback
We conducted user research sessions with rural patients and healthcare providers to refine our prototype. Key feedback includes:

- Patients prefer voice-enabled interactions for accessibility.
- Healthcare providers need clear AI-assist guidelines for triage.
- Some patients struggle with technology, requiring a simplified UI.

## LLM Prompt Library
This project utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-generated prompts for user research, prototype development, and hypothesis validation. Below is a library of key prompts used:

### Prompts for User Research
- "What are the biggest challenges rural healthcare providers face in Adams when delivering telemedicine services?"
- "How do rural patients prefer to interact with AI-powered healthcare tools?"
- "Generate a structured interview guide to assess the needs of rural healthcare providers in Adams."

### Prompts for Lovable Prototype Development
- "Design a conversational AI prompt that helps rural patients schedule a virtual consultation with minimal friction."
- "What UX improvements can be made to a virtual clinic for non-tech-savvy patients?"
- "Generate a step-by-step patient onboarding flow that reduces drop-off rates."

### Prompts for Hypothesis Validation
- "Given user research findings, what additional data is needed to validate the hypothesis that AI-powered clinics improve patient retention?"
- "Summarize key statistical methods to analyze the effectiveness of AI-based virtual clinics in rural areas."

### Prompts for AI-Driven Decision Support
- "Generate an AI-powered symptom checker prompt that follows HIPAA-compliant guidelines."
- "Design a chatbot prompt that educates diabetic patients about lifestyle management."

## How We Used These Prompts
- üîπ Fine-tuned LLM-generated insights to match real-world provider & patient needs.
- üîπ Iterated on prototype designs based on AI-assisted workflow recommendations.
- üîπ Validated hypothesis through AI-driven user feedback analysis.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
### üéØ Target Audience
- Patients with concerns for dental and vision health.
- Healthcare providers.

### üìà Adoption Plan
- **Clinic Onboarding:** We will partner with local healthcare providers, dental clinics, and optometrists to integrate the virtual clinic into their existing workflows. This includes training sessions for staff on how to use the AI-driven platform.
- **Patient Engagement:** Conduct community workshops, digital literacy training, and outreach programs in rural communities to ensure patients understand how to use the system.
- **Mobile & Telehealth Integration:** Provide mobile-friendly access and telehealth consultations to ensure seamless adoption by patients with limited internet access.

### üí∞ Sustainability
- **Funding Sources:** Seeking grants from healthcare foundations, state funding for rural telemedicine, and federal digital health initiatives.
- **Partnerships:** Collaborating with Accountable Communities of Health (ACH) and insurance providers to sustain the project.

## Legal & Compliance Considerations
This virtual clinic is designed to comply with state and local healthcare regulations to ensure ethical and legal operation. Key considerations:

- **HIPAA Compliance** ‚Äì All patient data is handled according to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations.
- **State & Local Regulations** ‚Äì The solution adheres to Washington State health policies governing telemedicine, AI-assisted diagnostics, and patient privacy.
- **Medical Liability & Scope** ‚Äì AI-based medical recommendations must comply with state guidelines on decision support tools and licensed healthcare provider oversight.
- **Data Retention & Consent** ‚Äì All patient interactions follow strict consent and data retention policies in line with Washington State law.

## Security & Data Protection
We prioritize patient data security with the following measures:

- üîí **End-to-End Encryption** ‚Äì All sensitive data transmissions are encrypted (TLS 1.2+).
- üîë **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ‚Äì Only authorized users (providers, staff) can access certain data.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Storage** ‚Äì Patient records are stored in HIPAA-compliant cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Incident Reporting** ‚Äì A security response protocol is in place to address data breaches or unauthorized access.

## Licensing
This project operates under:

- **Open Source Licensing** ‚Äì MIT License.
- **Medical Software Certification** ‚Äì Pending review for FDA and state-level digital health approval (if required).
- **Usage Restrictions** ‚Äì AI models used in this project are for clinical decision support, not autonomous medical diagnoses.

## Collaboration with Local Health Jurisdictions & ACH Organizations
To ensure effective deployment, we are coordinating with:

- **Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJ)** ‚Äì Engaging with [County Health Department] to ensure alignment with public health goals.
- **Accountable Communities of Health (ACH)** ‚Äì Partnering with [ACH Organization] to integrate with existing rural healthcare networks and Medicaid-funded services.
- **Provider Networks** ‚Äì Collaborating with rural hospitals, clinics, and telemedicine providers to validate workflows.
- **Community Outreach** ‚Äì Conducting educational programs for patients on using the virtual clinic effectively.
